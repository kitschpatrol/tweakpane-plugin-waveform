_**Deprecated. Use [tweakpane-plugin-waveform](https://github.com/shoedler/tweakpane-plugin-waveform) instead.**_

**This was a fork of [tweakpane-plugin-waveform](https://github.com/shoedler/tweakpane-plugin-waveform) with Tweakpane 4.0 compatibility.**

The fork is no longer necessary since the [PR on the upstream project](https://github.com/shoedler/tweakpane-plugin-waveform/pull/2) has been merged.
